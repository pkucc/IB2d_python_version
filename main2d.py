 IB2d is an Immersed Boundary Code (IB) for solving fully coupled non-linear 
 	fluid-structure interaction models. This version of the code is based off of
	Peskin's Immersed Boundary Method Paper in Acta Numerica, 2002.

 Author: Nicholas A. Battista

 Date Created: May 27th, 2015\
 Python 3.5 port by: Christopher Strickland
 Institution: UNC-CH

 This code is capable of creating Lagrangian Structures using:
 	1. Springs
 	2. Beams (*torsional springs)
 	3. Target Points
	4. Muscle-Model (combined Force-Length-Velocity model, "HIll+(Length-Tension)")

 One is able to update those Lagrangian Structure parameters, e.g., 
 spring constants, resting lengths, etc
 
 There are a number of built in Examples, mostly used for teaching purposes. 
 
 If you would like us to add a specific muscle model, 
 please let Nick (nick.battista@unc.edu) know.
